            Given a velocity at a wheel contact point, calculate the speed in revolutions per second at which the wheel

            Method: we want to find the projection of the velocity onto the vector representing the drive of this wheel.
            We store the vector representing a single revolution of travel as self.vector, so the projection onto this
            would be velocity.dot(self.vector / abs(self.vector)). However, we want revolutions per second, so we must
            then divide again by abs(self.vector), leading to
            velocity.dot(self.vector / abs(self.vector))/abs(self.vector). Because the definition of the dot product is
            the sum of x1*x2, y1*y2, ... any scalar applied to each x, y ... of a single vector can be moved outside
            the dot product, so we can simplify as velocity.dot(self.vector) / abs(self.vector)^2. As the magnitude of
            the vector is taken by sqrt(x^2+y^2) we can simply express this as (x^2+y^2), held in the convenient
            function magnitude_squared(). So our final simplified form is
